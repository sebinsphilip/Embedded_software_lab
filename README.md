# Embedded_software_lab
<!-- As part of the course "Embedded systems" we were given Altera DE-2 board along with basic hardware config
as well as the BSP for compilation (in Lab1, attached as ["il2206-lab1-1.2.2.pdf"](il2206-lab1-1.2.2.pdf)). Here we utilized basic HAL layer/assembly functions to implement on top of already given FPGA hardware IPs/configs. In the second lab (attached as ["il2206-lab2-rtos.pdf"](il2206-lab2-rtos.pdf)) we mainly utilized the real-time OS uCOS-II RTOS for its properties like tasks, semaphore, and other real-time objects to realize applications. In both the labs it was mostly focused on applications on top of the hardware IPs and making everything "work". -->

As part of "Embedded software", the lab work was to :

"Parallel Multi-core (5-cores) implementation of Edge detection filters (Image processing) on Altera Nios II FPGA using bare metal and uCOS-II RTOS. Throughput requirement of 320 images per second (32x32 pixels). Involved Design space exploration of different actors and mapping different tasks on multiple processors considering real-time (deadline) requirements and utilizing parallel programming constructs." (lab descriptions as ["EmbeddedSoftware_Lab1.png"](EmbeddedSoftware_Lab1.png), ["EmbeddedSoftware_Lab2.png"](EmbeddedSoftware_Lab2.png)). Here as well we were given hardware IP templates/implementations for both single-core and multi-core.

The complete lab report is given as ["ESLabReport.pdf"](ESLabReport.pdf).
